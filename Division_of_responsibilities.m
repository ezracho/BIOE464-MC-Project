% Ezra: create random moving subroutine, check for overlaps
% Jorge: write the energy function
% Rebecca: initialize the simulation (box, particles)
% Ezra wuz here
% Jorge Got it
%   Variable names
%               r = distance between particles
%               rred = reduced distance
%               sigma = diameter of the particle
%               epsilon = well depth = Energy
%               U = potential energy
%               Ured = reduced energy
%               F = Force
%               Fred = reduced force
%               RCoff = cut off radius
%               npart = number of particles
